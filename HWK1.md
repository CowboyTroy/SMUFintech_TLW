# QuantConnect 2020 – “Democratizing Finance, Empowering Individuals”

## Overview and Origin


After building and developing his own quantitative trading and portfolio management tools, Jared Broad realized a need for Quants to be able to have an open source platform to effectively back-test and launch their strategies. Hence, he founded QuantConnect in 2011 with an undisclosed amount of his own capital. The company currently operates on a shoestring budget/capital base with a minimal team of 8, but they have plans to quickly expand into the institutional market and managed funds space via the launch of their new Organizations platform. They currently are projected to pull in around $4 million in annual revenue from over 100,000+ quants/contributors worldwide.


## Business Activities:


### “WE BELIEVE IN COLLABORATION, RADICAL OPENNESS AND COMMUNITY.”

“QuantConnect’s goal is to unlock access to institutional-grade technology, leveling the algorithmic trading playing field and diversifying market participation. It was our founding principle and it remains our only focus today.”

### “WE BELIEVE GENIUS IS DISTRIBUTED.”

“We believe bright minds come from everywhere. We know that great talent isn’t found only in New York or the Ivy League. QuantConnect aims to provide an opportunity for a diverse community of brilliant thinkers to learn, show off their skills and do fulfilling work. We nurture a global community of quantitative engineers to build algorithms and contribute to the LEAN code base. The community shapes the technology design and helps bring the project to fruition in our open-source, decentralized, hybrid-cloud environment.”

“QuantConnect will anchor this global community; educating, concentrating and collecting the insights of the brightest minds to become a global factory of alpha. Funds will compete for these bright minds in a lightning-speed Darwinian evolution to find and fund strategies through an API, giving individuals income from their work at scale.”

The company intends to directly license alpha from individual quants through their Alpha Streams Market for managed funds, Fintech firms, and institutions. It essentially empowers individuals to compete, improve and attribute the credit/reward directly to them while securing their individual, intellectual property.

### “WE BELIEVE THE FUTURE OF INVESTMENT WILL BE AUTOMATED.”

“We believe fund management professionals will increasingly seek powerful new technology to design investments and manage their positions. Driven by investor and regulatory pressures, funds will demand efficiency, automation and accountability. Rather than reinvent complex technology, we envisage QuantConnect powering these investments with our open-source platform, LEAN. By serving financial technology companies, investment funds and brokerage trading platforms, the LEAN API will become a ubiquitous element at the core of the financial industry, providing a common foundation for efficient algorithm design.”

QuantConnect currently utilized a hybrid-cloud solution to provide its customers the ability to scale on demand. This provides a huge rebalancing of the scales between institutions and the individual in terms of computing capability. With this technological balancing, individuals can focus on the engineering of their algos over the computing requirements.


## Landscape:


QuantConnect is in the Investment Management domain of FinTech with a more specific focus on Algorithmic Trading. The major trends in this domain over the last 5-10 years have been steadily moving more towards automation over the traditional, large labor requirements for trading desks. The Algos can handle the same level of execution/management for fractions of the cost. 

In addition, increased regulatory requirements are driving more accountability towards transaction cost analysis across the industry. With the continuation of these industry trends, it isn’t far-fetched to believe that all financial instrument trading will be performed via automation within my lifetime.

There are several competitors at various levels in this space. Some are direct institutional hedge funds whereas others are algo supporting FinTech companies just emerging/defining their core competencies. It’s difficult to compare “apples to apples” as each company really specializes or focuses in one competency that the other does not. Even so, there is still some cross-over for a reasonable level of comparison.

Direct competitors appear to be AlgoTrader, Quantopian (which recently went under) FlexTrade (though this is more institutional execution in Europe, not US), Quantiacs (US), Numerai (US), Cloud9trader (UK), Uqer.io (CN), and Backtrader (US). 

Indirect competitors are all the large institutional hedge funds already developing their own Algorithmic Trading Strategies that would compete with QuantConnect and their Alpha production via the individual. Examples of these firms are Citadel, Bridgewater Associates, Renaissance Technologies, and D.E. Shaw & Co to name a few. 



## Results

Given rapidly evolving fields of Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning, the impact of the company thus far is difficult to measure. QuantConnect hasn’t truly ramped up the monetization of the company’s offerings yet, but they are in the process of doing so via the new launch of their Organizations platform for managed funds / institutions. This should amplify their goals of leveling the playing field for individuals against the incumbent institutions (indirect competitors) that have dominated the field for the last 10-20 years. 

Some core metrics would be AUM under each company’s respective platform, but again, that’s still not “apples to apples” as large institutions like Bridgewater Associates have billions of dollars at their disposal against Jared’s Even so, the competition over computing power, which I believe to be a very relevant metric in the comparison of the competitors in this stage, has been leveled. Individuals, like myself, can now compete on the primary basis of our strategies over the computing cost barriers to entry that previously prevented us from doing so. That’s a metric of success that is difficult to quantify but greatly appreciated. None of the competitors offer the same access to data and back-testing ability for such a low, all inclusive price like QuantConnect.


## Recommendations

If I were to advise the company, I would continue to expand on the data sets that are made available to the clients. In addition, I would focus on the Order & Execution Management Systems to adhere to the increased regulatory requirements for managed funds and institutions. Finally, I would advise them to improve their AI/Machine Learning capabilities, because that’s the direction the industry is going. If they fall behind “out the gate,” so to speak, they will never be able to catch up to the frontrunner. 
These technologies are appropriate for my solution as they are the foundations on which the future technologies will be developed. As increased data becomes available via the IOT, the world will need competent ways to classify, organize and asses, in real time, for future demands across all industries. Finance just happens to have large data sets already available for the modeling and testing of these technologies to be applied to other fields soon. The time to build the foundations for these expansions is now. The 2nd Renaissance is coming. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is here! All aboard!
